# The Event Fairy
We created The Event Fairy for anyone seeking new adventures. With this app, you can browse Public Events, which are open to anyone, or Private Events, which are more exclusive. Create your own events, add other users as contacts, and invite them to your events, all in one place.

## Future Development

- Ability to invite users by email if they are not registered in the app.

- Invitation scalability -- implement search bar to search through contacts in order to add them to an event
- Friends instead of Contacts -- requires one user to send a request and another to accept; makes the relationship mutual
