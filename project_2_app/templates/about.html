            Karra Batcheller is an unassuming single mom by day and a fairy by night.  Oftentimes that fairy is the toothfairy, but she likes to believe that the job is as full of magic as her children believe.  She strives to bring the magic of children into the wider world, allowing jaded adults everywhere to rediscover their inner sparkle.
